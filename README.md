# CTI Blueprints

CTI Blueprints is a free suite of templates and tools that helps Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) analysts create high-quality, actionable reports more consistently and efficiently. CTI analysts face many challenges in creating consistent, actionable reports, including time and resource constraints, lack of analytic training and guidance, and lack of feedback from customers on what works. This project provides a set of solutions that increase the operational relevance of reports through a standardized set of templates that help analysts answer specific analytic questions for common cyber security use cases, sample reports that demonstrate best practices for each type of report, and a set of tools for publishing both human and machine-readable reports. This project is created and maintained by the MITRE Engenuity Center for Threat-Informed Defense in futherance of our mission to advance the start of the art and the state of the practice in threat-informed defense globally. The project is funded by our research participants.
